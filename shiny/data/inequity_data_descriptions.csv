de,Social-Ecological Vulnerability,Degraded ecosystems,Species at risk gravity: degree of exposure of coastal human population to coastal ecosystem degradation,"Estimates the mean gravity value of a marine raster within a terrestrial buffer radius for each coastal populated pixel. The number of threatened marine and coastal species by several stressors (hereafter “marine raster”) is used. For each coastal populated pixel, a 150 km buffer was created to crop the marine raster. A distance matrix was calculated from the populated pixel centroid to identify the nearest marine pixel. A 20 km buffer radius was created around the identified marine pixel. The mean number of threatened marine and coastal species affected by one or more stressors within the 20km buffer was estimated. For each coastal populated pixel, the species at risk gravity-adjusted mean was estimated by dividing the mean number of threatened species by the square of the distance to the identified nearest marine pixel.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,mean.count.grav.V2.log.sc
rdi,Social-Ecological Vulnerability,Relative Deprivation Index,Relative levels of multidimensional deprivation and poverty based on local socio-economic and demographic conditions.,"Harmonized dataset of 6 dimensions of deprivation and poverty: child dependency ratios; infant mortality rates; human wellbeing based on education, health and standard of living; building footprints per square kilometer; changes in the average intensity of nighttime lights; slope of metric of night-time lights. Uses information on pixel level population (5km) sourced from the Gridded Population of the World (GPWv4) (24).We then constructed a coastal population raster at 5 km resolution within 100 km from the coastline. We choose the coastal population within 10 m of sea level as an estimate of coastal populations exposed to potential sea level rise.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,povmap.grdi.v1.sc
cv,Social-Ecological Vulnerability,Climate Vulnerability,Ratio of the number of small-scale marine fishers to the national economically active population (30).,Estimates the proportion of coastal populations globally that are vulnerable to sea level rise by calculating the share of population located within 10 meters of elevation and 100 km from the coastline. The data is derived from the Gridded Population of the World v4 (GPWv4) and processed into a coastal raster with 5 km resolution. The final value is log-transformed to reduce skew and better represent relative differences across regions.,Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,perc.pop.world.coastal.merit.10m.log.sc
med,Social-Ecological Vulnerability,Marine Employment Dependency,Percentage of the total population that lives below 10 m.,"Based on statistics of the UN FAO, International Labour organization and from published literature. Since data on small-scale fisheries provided by member countries lead to underestimation of employment, and that Teh and Sumaila (2013) overestimate employment, the average value of the extrapolated data of Teh and Sumaila (2013) and the reported data from available country-level studies was taken.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,Economic.dependence.sc
mnd,Social-Ecological Vulnerability,Marine Nutritional Dependency,"Per capita consumption of fish and seafood, including crustaceans, cephalopods and other mollusc species (26).","Quantifies a population’s dependence on marine ecosystems for nutrition, measured as per capita seafood and fish consumption, including crustaceans, mollusks, and cephalopods. Values were initially per capita and converted to total consumption using national population data from FAO. This variable reflects the importance of marine resources in daily diets across different countries.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,Nutritional.dependence.sc
lva,Weak Governance,Low Voice and Accountability,"The opportunity for effective participation of all relevant actors in governance; Respect for all relevant actors and their knowledge, values, identities and institutions.","Measures voice and accountability as part of governance quality. This reflects the ability of citizens to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media. Data is compiled from over 30 individual sources (e.g., surveys and expert assessments), spanning 1996–2022. A Unobserved Components Model (UCM) is used to aggregate and rescale the data across countries and time, ensuring comparability. Values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating stronger voice and accountability.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,Voice_account.sc
wrl,Weak Governance,Weak Rule of Law,"The extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society”, and in particular the “quality of contract, property rights, the police and the courts, and the likelihood of crime and violence.","Captures the extent to which individuals and institutions have confidence in and abide by the rules of society. This includes measures of the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. The data is drawn from the Worldwide Governance Indicators project using the UCM framework for consistency across sources and time.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,Rule_law.sc
wcc,Weak Governance,Weak Control of Corruption,"The extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as capture of the state by elites and private interests","Indicates the level of control over corruption, which encompasses the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain. This includes both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as the influence of elites and private interests in public institutions. The score is based on a composite of global surveys and expert assessments compiled under the Worldwide Governance Indicators.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,control_corr.sc
pi,Weak Governance,Political Instability,"Perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and/or politically motivated violence, including terrorism.”","Reflects perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and politically motivated violence, including terrorism. It is part of the Worldwide Governance Indicators and uses aggregated expert and survey-based data from various sources. Values close to 0 indicate high instability, while higher values reflect greater political stability.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,Political_stab.sc
gvi,Weak Governance,Government Ineffectiveness,"The quality of public services, of civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government’s commitment to these policies.","Measures the quality of public services, the capacity of the civil service, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government’s commitment to these policies. Based on data from the Worldwide Governance Indicators, this composite measure is rescaled to a 0–1 range using UCM aggregation techniques.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,Gov_effect.sc
prq,Weak Governance,Poor Regulatory Quality,Perceptions of the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote public sector development.,"Represents perceptions of the government’s ability to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development. Like the other governance indicators, it is constructed from multiple sources, aggregated with the UCM, and scaled for international comparability.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,Reg_quality.sc
gei,Social Inequality,Gender Inequality,Female Labor Income Share ,"Indicates the share of total labor income earned by women, as a proxy for gender inequality in economic participation. This variable is based on harmonized employment and income survey data from the ILO, Luxembourg Income Study, and EU-SILC. Where data was missing, a two-step imputation was applied: (1) regression-based estimation using wage and self-employment shares, and (2) extrapolation using ILO employment data.",Df.cont.inequity.compo.coastal.scores_sr.rds,gender.ineq.sc
iale,Social Inequality,Inequality Adjusted Life Expectancy,,"Captures inequality in life expectancy, as part of the inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).
